<h4>6 months earlier</h4>
<p>Lu was laughing so hard she almost fell off the bar stool she was perched on next to Carla. The blonde slapped her arm. "You are such a bitch!" she told Lu before dissolving into a fit of laughter herself. "I'm glad my misery is so funny to you." Carla tried and failed miserably to sound serious. "I was mortified, I wanted to DIE. Not sure what was worse, the look on Samu's face as he tried to pull up the covers or Pilar's eyeroll."</p>
<p>"What was she doing at Samuel's place anyway?" Lu asked.</p>
<p>"Supposedly she was in the neighborhood… Yeah, I didn't believe it either. She obviously misses her baby boy and has no concept of personal space. I was <em>thisclose</em> to demanding Samuel ask her for her key back."</p>
<p>Lu wiped away tears of laughter before waving over the bartender. "Two more gin and tonics, please." When they had gotten to Ginkgo two hours ago, Carla was going to order wine, but Lu knew how that would go. One sip, critical head tilt, another sip and then Carla would be asking the poor guy who served them a million questions, very few of which he would be able to answer. "Nope, not tonight." Lu had grabbed the wine menu from her oldest friend. "No work tonight. And don't even start that bullshit about how drinking wine isn't work. It is when you do it. I get exhausted and I'm just watching you." Three gin and tonics later, Lu was very happy with her life decisions. She hadn't had this much fun in weeks.</p>
<p>The bartender set their drinks down in front of them. Carla grabbed hers, but then set it down again. "Oh, hey- Samu asked when we could go on another double-date with you guys. He's still bragging about how he finished off more sushi than Rafael last time."</p>
<p><em>Shit</em>. Lu had hoped that Rafael wouldn't come up. She took a long sip of her drink - were they getting <em>more</em> generous with the gin the later it got? - to buy herself some time. But she could only pretend to be savoring the alcohol for so long. "Actually… we broke up."</p>
<p>Carla stared at her. "What?"</p>
<p>"Guess Samuel will need to find himself a new sushi buddy. I hope he won't be too disappointed," Lu said with a shrug, looking at her nails. But she couldn't fool the woman across from her. " We've been here for hours and you haven't mention that? You have been going out with him for more than half a year! I thought you two might become serious. Lu-" Carla tried to grab her hand, but Lu pulled away. "Hey, it's not like he was the guy that I was going to spend the rest of my life with," Lu said. "We had fun and now it's over. Not all of us end up in boring domestic bliss with our high school sweethearts, even though there must've been something in the water at Las Encinas…"</p>
<p>Lu could tell from the look in Carla's eyes that her spiel wasn't working. That's what she got for being best friends with the same person since she was 13. If the situation had been different, Lu would have been touched by how concerned her friend was. There was a time back in high school when this, exactly this, had been all she wanted. For a split second, Lu imagined letting herself be wrapped up in Carla's hug, the two of them going back to her place and her sharing every last detail about why she and Rafael could never work, while Luis Miguel played in the background. They could even have wine.</p>
<p>Then Lu returned to reality. She couldn't possibly tell Carla the full story of why she broke up with the charming med student with the stupid great hair. But from the way Carla looked at her, she couldn't sell her some bullshit about getting bored and moving on either. <em>Fuck</em>. She was going to have to give Carla a small part of the truth. "Guys aren't really into women who wake up screaming next to them in the middle of the night and then won't tell them what's wrong," Lu said, trying to sound matter-of-fact about what had definitely been her worst night in recent memory.</p>
<p><em>The corner of her bedside table pushing into her spine as she cowered on the bedroom floor. Rafael's voice getting higher and louder with every passing second. His eyes desperately searching her face, his hands smoothing down her hair because he was afraid to touch any other part of her.</em></p>
<p>"It scared him. I was hyperventilating and he kept asking me what was wrong, tried to get me to talk, saying he wanted to <em>help</em>." Lu spit out the last word. "It was the second time he was there for one of those and I just- I realized he would never stop asking questions and I would never be able to tell him what happened, what I did, so… I figured we should end it." This time, she let Carla hug her.</p>
<p>"How often does that still happen?" Carla asked her quietly, trying to look her in the eye. "Not that often," Lu said. "Three, four times a year." She figured it was a pretty good deal. A quarterly night of absolute terror as the only consequence of murdering someone? Lucky her.</p>
<p>The first few weeks after the high school graduation from hell, she had been in shock. Then the nightmares had started. Lu sometimes still wondered how Nadia had put up with her after moving to New York. She must have been the worst roommate ever, waking up multiple times a week crying, screaming or gasping for air at 3 am, 5 am, or, once, at 4 pm from what was supposed to be a relaxing Sunday afternoon nap. Lu didn't take naps anymore.</p>
<p>She had been cruel to Nadia in an effort to push her away, had been short-tempered and angry and very, very drunk more nights during their first semester at Columbia than she cared to remember. But her friend never let go and eventually, it got better. Lu had no illusions about the fact that she owed her life to two people, and Nadia was one of them.</p>
<p>Carla paid for their drinks and when they stepped out of Ginkgo into the night, the air was so soft that they decided to walk for a bit. Lu could feel Carla looking at her. After a few minutes of silently braving the cobblestones on their heels, Carla let out a long breath. "Why haven't you told me you still have nightmares? You know that I'm not- that I never-" "I know." Lu grabbed her hand. "It's just that, when I'm not in the middle of thinking about it, I really don't want to think about it. But it's great to talk to someone who knows, who doesn't ask me to explain." That wasn't a lie. Lu felt relieved. Didn't mean it wasn't still painful, though.</p>
<p>"Well, now you know why I couldn't let McDreamy stick around," Lu said. Her attempt to end their night on a positive note was pathetic, but Carla laughed anyway and gave her a side hug. In this moment, Lu appreciated her more than anything in the world. "Well." Carla grinned. "It's too bad. Samuel is going to take it pretty hard."</p>
<p>When Lu got home, she was exhausted. It was like her hangover had decided not to wait until the next morning, but to make an appearance then and there. Lu took off her heels, dropped them right where she stood and walked into her bedroom where she let herself fall into bed. All that talk about breaking up with Rafael made her long for one person, and one person only. She dug her cell out of her purse and sent a two-word text.</p>

<hr>

<p>Her phone rang three minutes later. "Hey, you." Lu could feel herself relax at the sound of Valerio's voice. "Hey," she replied quietly. "Are you alright?" he asked. How did he do that from just one word? "You're creepy, you know that?" she told Val. "I could just be drunk. In fact, I am actually a little bit drunk right now." She could hear him snort on the other end of the line. "I never would've guessed." There was a pause. Then he said "I missed hearing your voice."</p>
<p>Lu couldn't stop herself. "Well, phones work both ways, you know? You could have called. But maybe you were too busy rearranging your closet or making room for her toothbrush or something." Valerio sighed. "I didn't know whether you were still mad at me- " "No, no, it's fine, I was kidding." Lu felt a shiver go through her body and for a moment she thought she might throw up. Then the moment passed.</p>
<p>She decided she needed to turn the conversation around. She hadn't called Val to feel <em>worse</em>. "So I had drinks with Carla tonight and Samuel's mom caught her and Samu fucking," she told him. "I bet they are not going to be doing it at his place for the next 75 years." Val burst into laughter. The sound still made her irrationally happy, like she had won a prize by telling the right story. "Oh my God," he got out. "Can I tease her about that on Monday? I will definitely tease her about that on Monday. Why was his mom even there?"</p>
<p>Lu felt her whole body relax while they were making fun of Carla. God, she wished Val was next to her right now. After some back and forth about her night and the book he currently had on his nightstand ("Are you reading that because you want to or because Oprah told you to?"), both of them were quiet for a moment. She could listen to him breathe forever. She knew that a lot of her friends were uncomfortable with phone calls because they thought they were awkward and that texting was so much more convenient. But some of her most intense moments in life she remembered mostly through the calls she had with Val.</p>
<p>His performative disgust, masking something else, when she had called him to brag about her first time with Guzman. His quiet, seething fury when she told him their dad had slapped her across the face, hard, after she failed her 20<sup>th</sup> century Spanish politics midterm. His exuberant happiness and pride about her recent promotion that she couldn't wait to tell him about, so she had called him from the Uber home.</p>
<p>And, of course, the 3 am phone calls when he was the only human being on the planet whose voice she wanted to hear - the only voice who would get through to her, would get through the haze of dream, memory and panic and would pull her back into the real world.</p>
<p>
	<em>Polo's voice wouldn't stop saying Nobody loves you, nobody loves you, and her heart was beating so hard it hurt and the world was tilting so she crawled out of bed and over to her desk so she had something to lean against, but there wasn't enough air and now everything was spinning and a girl was touching her shoulder and talking at her but she couldn't hear and this girl turned on the lights and then she was holding her phone up to Lu and suddenly- "Lu? What's wrong?" She heard Val's voice. "Hey, look at me. You're safe, Lulu. Everything's ok, try to take a deep breath. Good, ok, and another one." Lu looked around. She was in her dorm room in New York. Nadia - of course, the girl was Nadia - was sitting across from her on the floor holding up her phone, with Valerio on the other end of a Facetime call. "Can you tell me what happened?" And just like that she was back in her dream, with blood streaming down her hands and Polo's voice echoing around her and the light was too bright and she was crying and Nadia looked scared. "Lu, it's ok, you don't need to tell me," Val said. "Just focus on my voice. Deep breaths, remember? You can do this. Close your eyes and count to ten with me, ok? One, two, three…"</em>
</p>
<p>"So." Lu took a deep breath. "I told Carla about the nightmares." Valerio took a second to adjust to the gear change. "Why? Did you have one recently?" Lu shook her head. "No, no reason, it just… came up." "Really?" Val sounded skeptical. "How did you go from Samu's mother walking in on them to this?"</p>
<p>Lu squeezed her eyes shut. There was no way she was getting into the Rafael of it all now, unprepared, drunk, fully dressed in her bed. She had wanted comfort, a distance-hug, not an interrogation. "Well, <em>Carla</em> was great about it, really made me feel better, thanks for asking," Lu said sharply. Val apologized, telling her he was glad she had opened up like that to her friend. They talked about nothing for another few minutes before she got impatient.</p>
<p>"Are you alone?" Lu made herself ask. She was almost sure, since Val hadn't put the phone down to explain who he was talking to. But better safe than sorry. "Yes. One of Leo's friends from home is in town and she's taking her out for tapas and then drinks. She's gonna be out late." The first word was all Lu needed before she lifted her legs off the mattress to discard her thong.</p>
<p>She could practically hear Val's grin through the phone: "Why do you ask?" <em>That fucker.</em> "Shut up," Lu groaned, her hand moving toward her center. "Tell me what you're going to do to me. Now."</p>

<p>Their Father is far too weak to make the trip, even if it hadn’t been that far. So it is up to Jacob to drive his sister and see her off to University. He made a show of being bothered and having plans. If only to annoy Ethan. He was going to drive her there anyway, that was the plan ever since Evie brought it up. He just hated that his father would order him to do it. Jacob also hated that he couldn’t just pack up and follow her. No. He had to stay.</p>

<p>Ethan had been sick for some time now. Evie wouldn’t have even thought of going if it hadn’t been for the two Frye men who pushed her to do it. She didn’t need to screw up her future, they had said, agreeing with each other for the first time. She had a bright future for herself and it wasn’t like Jacob ever wanted to spend more time in his education. So it was obvious he would have to stay. Jacob wasn’t the most responsible son but he could handle taking care of their father just fine. He’d made sincere efforts for the past few weeks, to convince his sister that she could go without so much as a worry.</p>

<p>It only saddened him that she had to leave just when they’d started to understand their feelings for each other. After years of pining for each other, the dam finally broke. It was the happiest summer they had spent together.</p>

<p>Though only a few hours away, Evie asked to be driven down a day earlier. Given her disposition to wanting to plan and prepare for everything, Ethan thought it was because she wanted to get a head start with classes and making connections. In truth, the siblings wanted one more day to themselves. It was nothing short of memorable.</p>

<p>Jacob wished that time would stop. But it wasn’t like he had the powers of gods or something. So after helping Evie move in and unpack, he was on his way.</p>

<p>She had told him not to text and drive so he waited until he was finally back in hell. If hell was dull, dreary and forever damp. He parks on the driveway and waves at George, who had looked after Father in their absence. George had peeked through the window and waved at him. Jacob wished he could drive off again. But Evie would never forgive him if he ran out. Not that he would. He and his father may have their differences but he wasn’t some bastard to leave him in his hour of need. If there was one thing he and Ethan could agree on other than Evie furthering her studies, it was that family came first. Jacob simply sighed, resigned to the fact that he was stuck in Crawley for a little while longer. He pulled out his phone and tapped away, eager to hear any new developments from his sister.</p>

<p>Funny. For years he’d been desperate to avoid her, after realizing how he’d felt for her. Now he couldn’t get enough of her. The holidays couldn’t come any sooner.</p>

<p>She responds after a few minutes. She’s not used to picking up her phone ever so often like he did.</p>

<p>He smiles anyway, sure that she was doing the same thing.</p>

<p>He’d been afraid they would become different after they had started their ‘affair’. But he was glad to know some things never changed. Not that it didn’t make him hurt a little when she brushed off his attempts to show affection. But that was simply how Evie was. Besides, he was still a lucky man. She could have pushed him away in disgust, perhaps never spoke to him again. But instead she actually returned his love. If he was a believer in God, he would have called that a miracle. He was determined to work on this. He wasn’t sure what the future had in store for them, but he would worry about it then.</p>

<p>Still, it was sad she wasn’t close anymore. He already missed her. Man, he was whipped. Ah, it didn’t matter. It was Evie, after all.</p>

<p>If Jacob was ever worried about Evie meeting other people in the City, he was handling it as subtly as he could. But she knew anyway. He constantly bombarded her with anything he could possibly send over IM. From memes to what he’d hear as he went to town. How their father was, how her friends were. Maybe a song he thought she would like, or a video he’d find online. He’d call her every hour if he could, but she had told him that <em>she</em> would call him when she wasn’t busy. So he’d keep texting instead. He’d send selfies and photos of home, nonchalantly saying she might miss the simple country life over the busy, crowded and noisy city.</p>

<p>She did, though she wouldn’t tell him. He might just jump into a car and take her back home. She was afraid she’d let him. But failure was not an option. Frye men never gave up, and Frye women were just as stubborn. Then again, she had thought herself prepared but she wasn’t. The city was far from the small town of Crawley. Back in Crawley, she could at least tell everyone by face. There was no worry of danger as she walked down dark streets at night. The food was always fresh and somehow cheaper. The air wasn’t tainted with smoke and garbage. It was always loud. People never stopped moving, barely even able to say hi. She felt like some country hick and it was embarrassing. The streets were too full of people but her room was mostly empty, her room deserted more often than not. She had a roommate. His name was Ned. (It alarmed Jacob, but she’d explained. Ned was a trans man. Only here to please his parents until he’s of age and then he was going to leave for the States.) But he was never truly around. She didn’t know where he’d spend his nights but he hasn’t missed any of their electives together, so she wasn’t too worried. Besides, it gave her the privacy to call Jacob. She tried to keep the homesickness to herself, knowing how much Jacob sacrificed for her to be there. She tried to sound excited and upbeat with each call but all seeing Jacob’s face did was make her miss him more.</p>

<p>Not that they did much speaking when they were on video. She had a heavy workload and barely could glance up from her books and laptop. Jacob didn’t mind. He’d watch her at times as he had his after supper tea. Sometimes Father would be there too. But most of the time he either dozed off or minded his own business. It felt a bit like home the most when they were like that. When both of them were spending time together without actually doing anything together. She liked the silence and his company.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>As the weeks went by, Evie is barely able to give Jacob the time to call him or talk. Yes, it was the start of the semester but if she wanted to stay on top of it, she had to constantly learn more. Jacob would give her hell for it if he could, but he was just mostly thankful she could still respond. Even if it was just every now and then. She did notice how grumpy he was being recently and put it to him being stuck at home with Father more so than usual. He had a job but of course that only lasted a few hours. She suggested it might be the time to hang out with his friends. It would at least give her a few hours without his whining.</p>

<p>She expected him to be rather petulant about being told what to do. But it was a sign of how terrible he felt that he agreed and made plans to see his friends during the weekend. Evie’s evening however would be spent poring over books and researching online. She has no idea how her peers plan to graduate with how many gatherings and parties they throw. At first they had invited her. But after a while, they’d stopped bothering. She was here to earn her degree, that was all.</p>

<p>As was expected, Jacob messaged her in the wee hours of the morning. She actually didn’t notice the time until her phone pinged. When she looked up from her work, she suddenly felt the tiredness creeping in. Time for a short break, then. She reached for phone and grabbed a bottle of juice from the fridge.</p>

<p>Yep. Jacob was drunk.</p>

<p>She sighed wistfully. He’s probably fallen asleep. She hoped he at least made it to bed. But Jacob had probably passed out in the living room instead. No doubt later on he’ll be complaining about his neck and back. Once more, Evie wishes she was there with him. He’ll reek of beer and she would be scolding him. But at least after, they could crawl to bed together and sleep next to each other.</p>

<p>It still didn’t feel real sometimes. She <em>had</em> spent years denying her own feelings towards her own twin brother. It was unnatural and taboo. She thought that one day it would just go away. But instead, here they were now. <em>Lovers.</em> It was still weird to think about. But calling themselves, even privately, as boyfriend and girlfriend seemed far too shallow for how they felt for each other.</p>

<p>Ending up in Jacob’s arms felt like home to Evie. It was like every touch and kiss they shared, despite how wrong it had to be, felt right. It was a feeling deep within her that she could not explain. It was a rattling feeling in her bones, a rush of lightning surging through her entire being when he was close by. The simplest way she could ever word it was that she felt complete and whole and <em>full</em> next to him. Jacob was her soulmate, she was sure of it. It must have been some sort of cosmic joke that the universe pulled over them. Making it so that they wouldn’t have to spend years to find each other but at the same time, making it impossible to be together. At least, not outside the secret confines of four walls.</p>

<p>Jacob wouldn’t care. He already told her that much. It was she who insisted on keeping it secret. Not that she wanted to. Any woman would be lucky to have Jacob and it tore her that she couldn’t show him off like her friends could with their own partners. She wondered how she would handle the fact that Jacob was popular with her side of the species. She would probably go mad with jealousy. Evie knew because she didn’t want to share Jacob with anybody, even as kids. She’d been possessive. Which was possibly why they never had many playmates. Thankfully the one summer that they were able to spend together as a couple had little to no intrusions. And Jacob always made sure to let her know that he was hers and only hers.</p>

<p>Evie knew they had long since gone past the point of no return. She didn’t know what would happen to them either. It made her anxious, not having plans and back up plans. But this was Jacob she was with, after all. It wasn’t like there was anyone to help her out either. No, they would deal with this as they always had. Together. That alone leaves Evie feeling relieved. And if something like that was enough to keep her normally obsessive and controlling self at bay, then that was saying something. She really, truly loves Jacob.</p>

<p>He was more keen on showing her his affections, determined to make up for lost time and time they couldn’t have. She was more bashful and strict about it. Nevertheless, it didn’t stop him from trying. It made her fall in love with him even more. Not that she would tell him. He would get so cocky and it would grind on her nerves. Secretly, she was thrilled. No matter how corny and overconfident he got. Knowing Jacob loved her back made her feel like she could jump off the tallest buildings and grow wings.</p>

<p>Evie rolled her eyes. Well. It has been a while. The poor sod. Maybe she should cut him some slack.</p>

<p>Evie smirked and took a pose. That ought to do it.</p>

</p>

<p>Evie bites her lip, pleased with his reaction. Well. Their birthday was coming up. Maybe she should make plans with him. Rent a room like last time, perhaps? She could ask George to watch over Father for the night. Say Jacob could use some fun in the city… She’s about to ask Jacob what he thought but her phone trilled. And that’s the devil calling. Ah, well. She can think about it later. Jacob wasn’t the only one who had needs, after all.</p>

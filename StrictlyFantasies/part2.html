<p>Jacob’s days have been spent on finding ways to entertain himself when his father didn’t need him. He’s been bingeing a lot of things. He even got around to finally catching up on Star Wars. Honestly, he didn’t understand most of it but the effects were decent. And he’d seen a young Yoda meme making waves so he asked a mate and he hooked him up to a series. He found the dialogue boring and trite, mainly because he wasn’t focusing on anything at all but just waiting for the little green guy. Baby Yoda. Ha! What a cute and cheeky little thing. He had to share it to Evie. She didn’t like watching the telly but he was sure she’d like the little thing. And she’d at least get the reference, having watched some movies with him when they were young and over at Nan’s for a weekend or two while Father was away for work.</p>

<p>They had seen each other merely two weeks ago, when they had celebrated their birthday. It was not quite eventful, given that Jacob refused to share Evie with anyone on their one day alone. He’s sure she didn’t mind. She was barely coherent enough to speak to anyone else anyway. That was his doing, which made him swell with pride.</p>

<p>He wondered what to get her for Christmas. He didn’t make a habit of giving out presents to other people and he merely chipped in on whatever Evie got Father and Nan. So as per usual, he was only wondering what to get her. Last year he’d given her a new dress for Sunday mass. He would never admit it because she would chew him out for it but Evie in a dress was always a beautiful sight to see. And there were so few situations that she would be willing to wear them. And as Jacob was a man who wouldn’t let an opportunity slip by, he’d taken a leap of faith and bought the dress on a simple whim.</p>

<p>Not that they were the religious sort, but Father was keen on going to church for Christmas mass. The twins didn’t know why they kept to it because they didn’t know anyone there and he didn’t speak to anyone either. Ethan barely seemed to even listen. But to Ethan, the tradition must be of importance because there was never a year it was missed.</p>

<p>He was mulling over possibly getting her another dress but then some may say it seemed quite thoughtless and repetitive. Not that he cared what they thought. But what of Evie’s? She might not appreciate it. Those thoughts mattered the most to him. So he wondered maybe she could give a hint to something she’d like.</p>

<p>He sent a screenshot of him talking to Nan to Evie, knowing it would be an easy conversation starter. Evie absolutely adored Nan. This way she would bring about the topic of having Nan over for the holidays and talking about presents and things she’ll have to set aside for later because of holiday shopping.</p>

<p>But he gets sidetracked instead.</p>

<p>That <em>Greenie</em>. Hm.</p>

<p>He was sure the piss poor fellow wouldn’t have the courage to ask Evie out. But if he did, what would stop Evie from saying yes? She didn’t have a boyfriend to stave off the curious. It made Jacob’s chest ache. She did. If only he could tell them off. He worried now.</p>

<p>But since there wasn’t really anything he could do about it, even if he so so <em>so</em> wanted to, he was simply going to have to trust Evie.</p>

<p>He could no longer deny the feelings of possessiveness and selfishness that he’d hid and kept at bay for years now. And with Evie returning his affections, there was no need to. But that didn’t mean he was going to disrespect Evie. She was a big girl now. She could take care of herself. He only wished that he knew just how much she loved him back. It would ease some of the doubts he had. Not of them, of course. Jacob was adamant that they were made for each other. Two pieces of a whole indeed. And he knows he said it didn’t matter if she shot him down a lot and kept him on his toes but sometime… sometimes the doubt creeps in.</p>

<p>He’s not the most suitable man for Evie, or anyone else if he wanted to be honest to himself. And because she could choose to walk back into the straight and narrow anytime, Jacob was desperate to keep her. Or to have as much time as they could have together. There was no one else he’d rather be with. She could have someone else anytime. Buþ to him, it was her or nobody at all. However, it would be foolish to think and proclaim he could have her forever. He didn’t want to think of it because it opened up parts of him so raw it felt like death itself. He wouldn’t allow himself to dream of a future for them. He was going to focus on the now and hope that it would be at least enough to make her stay.</p>

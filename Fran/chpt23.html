<p>The world did not end. Contrary to what Cersei had felt after discovering the truth about her past, life went on. It was one of those specific instances, when you realize the world does not in fact revolve around you. What they had found out meant… nothing, really. Nothing pragmatic, for either of them. There was no sudden change, no big realization and no great shake-up. All they had found was their parents had flaws of their own, and Jaime and Cersei had paid for those: for Joanna’s gullibility and Tywin’s mournful lack of compassion following the death of the woman he loved.</p>

<p>With it came the sudden void of purpose.</p>

<p><em>Now what?</em></p>

<p>Cersei found herself thinking that quite often over the course of the days that followed.</p>

<p>She returned to Downing Street. Robert was not happy with her little escapade. She did not tell him what they had found out during their trip: just that she had needed time with Jaime, that it was a sibling thing.</p>

<p>Days later, she’d lounged in the bathtub for the better part of an afternoon, regardless of her pruning fingers, and the shivers once the water went cold. <em>Now what?</em> Yet again. <em>Now what?</em> Cersei knew what came now: life, pure and simple, and with it facing the reality of what was happening between Jaime and herself. As long as they had a ghost to chase, they could look the other way.</p>

<p>All of their ghosts were resting, at last.</p>

<p>They should not see each other again. Cersei knew it was the <em>only</em> solution. They would always be drawn to each other. Attractions like the one they shared did not simply go away. It was more than a habit, worse than a vice. Jaime had no control over it whatsoever, and Cersei…</p>

<p>Well, Cersei wanted it as much as he did, if not more. She craved it as much as beggars crave food for their children. She felt like her life depended entirely on it, on <em>him</em>. It scared her. She hated being dependent on someone. She had always been… enough for herself. Not happy, not whole. But enough.</p>

<p>He had shown her otherwise. Jaime had proven that it was possible for her to feel… different. Suddenly she was acutely aware of how small she felt whenever he was gone.</p>

<p>Yes, they should not see each other again.</p>

<p>(Briefly she had considered the option of <em>getting it out of their system</em>. Speaking from experience, she knew that never worked. It only had the opposite effect. Cersei had lost count of how many times she’d tried to quit smoking and caved because of that way of thinking. It was always going to be a failure.)</p>

<p>She could not bear not to see him again. Just the thought of his presence, consolatory, being ripped from her was painful. Physically painful. Like a pang of nausea, and cold sweat and legs quivering.</p>

<p><em>Withdrawals.</em></p>

<p>She sank into the bathtub, closed her eyes. Downing Street waited outside her locked door, she could hear the footsteps and the everyday noises. It wasn’t a home: it was a fucking graveyard where all her hopes and dreams had come to die.</p>

<p>When she finally returned to her bedroom. She was surprised to find Robert sitting at the end of her bed. He looked up, and Cersei tightened the bathrobe around her body. “What is it?” she asked, on the spot. She did nothing to conceal the hostility in her tone.</p>

<p>Robert did not reply right away. He let his eyes wander down her body, what little the bathrobe showed. When he smiled, it was sad. Cersei frowned; he seemed almost… apologetic.</p>

<p>“You can’t keep running away with him,” he said then, looking up.</p>

<p>“He’s my brother,” Cersei stated simply, to which Robert chuckled. “Just because you hate your brothers, doesn’t mean everyone else must.”</p>

<p>“Careful,” Robert warned. “You don’t get to speak about my family.”</p>

<p>“And yet you seem to have an awful lot to say about mine.”</p>

<p>Robert got to his feet slowly. Cersei knew how to recognize Robert’s attacks, when they came. This was not one. In fact, he did not leap. He just… stood there, looking down at the tips of his feet. He looked like a cumbersome fool.</p>

<p>“We need to work together,” he said at last. “I can’t be caught off guard in public, ever. I cannot be caught in a lie because I don’t know where you are. I am the Prime Minister. Reliability and trustworthiness are key.”</p>

<p>Cersei saw the reality of what he was saying, but the double standards… oh the double standards. “I don’t always know where you are.”</p>

<p>“But people don’t care what you have to say, do they?”</p>

<p>It rolled off his tongue with ease. He had not meant it to hurt her, but it did all the same. No matter what, no one would ever care what she had to say. He was right, she could not fault him for that. His methods may have been rude, tactless. But he was telling the truth of things.</p>

<p>“So,” she said, “what do you propose?”</p>

<p>“I have… asked Jaime to join us for dinner. Just the three of us. He accepted my invitation.” Robert took a step forward, holding a hand out. “I want us to be a family, Cers. I want to make it work.” Cersei frowned. “I’m sorry for… the things I’ve done.”</p>

<p>Standing there, hair wet and her bathrobe damp, she shivered. Robert’s hand was an offer she could not pinpoint. What was he trying to accomplish? What was his agenda, in asking for a truce?</p>

<p>This was not the time to antagonize him. And Jaime would be there, that evening.</p>

<p>She swallowed. “Fine,” she said, but still refused to take a hold of his hand. He got the message and let his arm fall back down his side. “I need to get dressed. Close the door.” Robert nodded, headed for the door and started closing it, but Cersei corrected him. “On your way out. Close the door on your way out.”</p>

<p>Something flashed across Robert’s features, but whatever it was he managed to keep himself at bay. Instead, he offered a small smile, a nod and left the room, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>Alone, she let out a breath she did not know she was holding back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole place smelled delicious, when Cersei finally left her room much later in the day. She had worn black for some reason; she felt like mourning. What, she did not know. They would have dinner downstairs, in the dining room that was usually destined to important guests. That was the same room where they had dined with the ambassador of Gabon and his wife. It did not feel intimate, nor familiar. It felt strategic.</p>

<p>Robert had dismissed everyone. For the first time, Cersei closed her eyes and heard nothing: silence, blissful and comforting. Downstairs, she followed the delicious smell of roasted meat into the kitchen. Inside, she found the cook and a house cleaner.</p>

<p>“Last ones standing?” she asked.</p>

<p>The cook looked surprised to see her there. “Yes ma’am,” he nodded. “The venison is almost ready. The mashed potatoes are in the second oven, as is the roasted veg. And there’s caramel pudding in the fridge.”</p>

<p>The wench added: “The Prime Minister insisted it should be just you and your guest tonight.”</p>

<p>Cersei frowned. “Well, who’s going to serve the food if everyone’s gone?”</p>

<p>The cook and the maid exchanged a look. The girl made an attempt: “Ma’am, the Prime Minister thought it would look better if you took credit for the venison. For your guest, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Please,” Cersei snorted, “as if my brother would ever believe I set foot in the kitchen.” Cersei looked around; she had never cooked, not really. She knew how to make fried eggs, for instance, but she had not actually ever <em>made them</em>. In fact, when she was a child she liked to watch people busy themselves by the stove. It felt… loving. “Just stay for supper. You’ll serve and then you’ll be free to go.”</p>

<p>Both nodded, and Cersei hesitated, wondering if she should thank them. <em>Jaime would thank them, if anything to be sure they don’t spit in our dishes.</em> But she was not Jaime.</p>

<p>Her feet brought her to the dining room then. The table had been set for three, but the seating couldn’t be more obvious. Two plates had been set at each end of the table – Cersei supposed Jaime and Robert’s – with the third one, hers, being closer to Robert’s. Cersei could see right through Robert’s intentions. He was showing Jaime that Cersei belonged to him, that he could not take her away from him, no matter how hard they both tried.</p>

<p>Ownership, this was what this dinner was about. What her life had always been about.</p>

<p>Her phone buzzed in her hand.</p>

<blockquote class="phone">
  <dl class="notifications">
    <div class="text">

<p>Yes, they could. She could run out the door, jump in his car, forget about Robert and Downing Street and the venison. He would take her some place she’d never been – like Tenerife – and perhaps she could be happy there. Happier, at least.</p>

<p>The doorbell rang, signalling the end of her daydreaming.</p>

<p>It had been three days since she’d seen him. Not much, compared to a lifetime spent apart. Seeing him on her doorstep brought a smile to her face all the same. He looked handsome in his blue suit. He held out a bouquet of red roses.</p>

<p>“Robert will love them,” she deadpanned, smirking.</p>

<p>Jaime stepped in, gave her the flowers and kissed her cheek. “You look ravishing,” he whispered, lips lingering at the shell of her ear.</p>

<p>Cersei knew she should chastise him for that. They’d dropped pretenses the moment he’d licked her clean off his fingers, back in Hull. “I know,” said, smelling the flowers. “Thank you.”</p>

<p>“For the flowers?” Jaime asked, knowing fully well what she was thanking him for. “It’s no big deal, sis.”</p>

<p>“Jaime Lannister,” Robert had just walked out the adjacent room, arms wide open in a welcoming gesture. “Come here, ya big charmer,” he added, pulling Jaime in a short embrace. “Hope you brought an appetite.”</p>

<p>Jaime was uncomfortable. He and Cersei shared a look. “Ehr, I… sure did.”</p>

<p>“This way then,” Robert continued, wrapping an arm around Jaime’s shoulders and dragging him along with him into the dining room. Cersei followed the odd pair, and couldn’t help grinning at how out of character Robert was acting, and how weirded out Jaime must be right about now.</p>

<p>In the dining room, Robert held out Cersei’s chair for her – a gesture which she could not remember the last time he’d made. As soon as they were all seated, he made a big show of kissing the back of her hand. Cersei fought the urge to snatch it away and wipe it clean.</p>

<p>“Wait till you try the venison,” Robert addressed Jaime, “She did it all by herself.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” she muttered under her breath, unfolding the napkin to place it on her lap. Jaime’s amused look did not escape her, and she made a mental note to tell him to fuck off later.</p>

<p>The table was long enough that Robert could squeeze her hand and Jaime could not notice it.</p>

<p>“Go and get it,” Robert said, very low, so only Cersei could hear it.</p>

<p>It sounded threatening. How on Earth could venison sound threatening? Cersei decided something was not right with Robert, not that night.</p>

<p>She rang the small silver bell and, within a few minutes, the girl from the kitchen was in the dining room, serving the three of them. Robert cast her a side-glance as she accepted her serving.</p>

<p>“Honestly Robert,” Cersei said, loud enough that Jaime would hear. “You can’t expect me to cook <em>and</em> serve. Else, sweet Camilla here would be out of a job.”</p>

<p>Jaime chuckled. Robert did not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dinner was… strained, at best. Robert tried to drag Jaime in endless conversations about hunting – something Cersei knew Jaime did not love, nor was any good at. Political talk was no good either, as Robert had not become Prime Minister for political reasons. For him it had been about who was bigger, who was better. The opponent had been Rhaegar Targaryen when he was alive, and… well, no one after his death. Robert found politics boring, useless. Tyrion had told her how little time he spent in his cabinet, discussing the reforms he had promised, bragged about.</p>

<p>The dessert had just been served, and the last of the help dismissed when Robert had broached the subject of Jaime’s military past.</p>

<p>“You were in the Army, weren’t you?” Robert asked, barely touching the pudding with his silver spoon.</p>

<p>Cersei had never heard about that. Truth be told, she realized there was a void in what she knew of Jaime’s past. A black hole of information he had not seen fit to disclose, and she had not asked about. <em>Silly of me.</em></p>

<p>Fleetingly, Jaime’s eyes went to Cersei for the briefest moment. “Yes,” he said, with the tone of someone who did not care to discuss it any further.</p>

<p>“Ah, a military man,” Robert said, tasting the pudding at last. As he tasted, Cersei knew his brain was working furiously. He swallowed. “Not many of you left, nowadays. Not <em>real</em> military men.”</p>

<p>Jaime’s eyes were fixed on his pudding. “What is a real military man, anyway?” he asked.</p>

<p>Cersei noticed the sadness that crossed her brother’s features then, and couldn’t help but wonder what that was. Of all the things Jaime struck her as, melancholic was not a word she would use to describe him. He lived in the present, stubbornly so. It was one of the things she loved about him. Yet, there it was, a shadow, a doubt, a crack.</p>

<p>Robert let out a laugh. “Ha! You are absolutely right! What <em>is</em> a military man? We should ask, shouldn’t we?” Her husband hesitated, then turned to her, to Cersei. “What is a military man to you, Cersei?”</p>

<p>Cersei had barely touched her dessert. She did not like the atmosphere around the table. She could sense Jaime’s uneasiness and Robert’s malice. It could mean nothing good for either of them. “A soldier is a soldier,” she replied, doing her best to change the subject. “This is extremely boring. Jaime, how’s Brightro-”</p>

<p>“A military man,” Robert interrupted her rather rudely, “I guess, is a man of principle, first and foremost. Someone sworn to defend.” He sipped from his wine. “Wouldn’t you say, Jaime? Loyalty is what makes a good military man.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jaime agreed. It was evident no one would eat the pudding that evening. “But loyalty to whom?” there was bitterness in Jaime’s voice, and a certain amount of hostility.</p>

<p>“To the Queen, for sure,” Robert said, raising his glass in a mockery of a toast, “and the people who act on her behaviour, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Such as the Prime Minister?” Jaime said.</p>

<p>“Such as the Prime Minister.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Cersei was at a loss: she was sure something was amiss, something that she wasn’t fully aware of. She hated to see Jaime struggle against Robert, but she could not defend him if she did not know the full picture. And she desperately wanted to see the full picture.</p>

<p>“Robert,” Jaime said, picking up his napkin and tossing it on the table. “I may not be as clever as my brother, but I’m not stupid. Enough of the pantomime. Why have you asked me here, tonight?”</p>

<p>Cersei was frozen on the spot. She wanted to come to Jaime’s aid, but she did not know how. He had walked willingly in Robert’s trap – she had done nothing to stop it. She had never, for once, believed Robert might have a hidden motive. Yet the urge to see him had been so great she had not wanted to let go of the chance.</p>

<p>She felt guilty, she wanted to end it here and now. To stand up, walk Jaime to the door and let him leave, to apologize and tell him she’d see him the next morning. That she would drop by The Rock and they would have lunch, and life would go on. She wanted to do that, but Robert was quicker.</p>

<p>“I need you to stop touching what’s mine, Jaime.”</p>

<p>Cersei looked up at that. She had a vague inkling of what he may mean. Judging by the anger on Jaime’s face, so did he.</p>

<p>“She’s not yours.”</p>

<p>Cersei was watching her brother, knowing him to be volatile and prone to anger. She knew he must be contained, that if Robert prodded long enough Jaime would lash out – he was a lion after all. “Jaime, don’t listen-”</p>

<p>“But she is.” Robert’s hand covered hers. She tried to snatch it, but he kept it there, flat on the table, his own fingers wrapped tightly around her wrist. Cersei looked at Jaime, pleading with her eyes not to rise to the bait. His knuckles were white. “That’s what your father told me.”</p>

<p><em>What?</em></p>

<p>Cersei turned to her husband, lips parted in surprise. “My…”</p>

<p>Robert looked confident, satisfied with the bomb he had just dropped. How long had he been holding that in? How long had he known? Jaime looked every bit as confused as her. There was pain, there was betrayal, and then there was whatever <em>this</em> was.</p>

<p>“You’re lying,” Jaime said.</p>

<p>Robert let her go, yet she could not move.</p>

<p>“You know, deep inside, I am not.” Robert took a spoonful of his pudding, blissfully oblivious of the shift in the room. Perhaps he did not know Jaime as much as Cersei. “So, I’m going to ask nicely. Please, stop touching my things.” He smiled, amused at the anger on Jaime’s face. “Stop… trying to drag her along in your stupid expeditions. Stop filling her head with nonsense about you and your lot. Your father gave her to me.”</p>

<p><em>I am not a thing to be given.</em></p>

<p>“You knew?” Cersei murmured. “All this time, and you knew, and you never said a thing?”</p>

<p>Robert had the decency to look contrite, at least. “He made me swear to never tell you. And I was fine with you not knowing.” Then pride overtook him, and he raised his voice. “Apparently, I was right! Look what happened! The moment <em>he</em> told you, you… became a different person. You used to be… not docile, never docile. But tameable.”</p>

<p>Cersei stood up. She could taste bile rising up her esophagus. “I don’t want to hear this,” she whispered. She felt light-headed, dizzy. “Jaime…?” She held out a hand, blindly, to her right, waiting for her brother. He did not make her wait long: soon she heard the scraping against the hardwood floor and the hurried footsteps approaching. When she felt him beside her, she murmured, “I don’t want to be here.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” he whispered, holding her by the waist, beginning to pull her with him.</p>

<p>“She’s not going anywhere,” came Robert’s voice, a low threat.</p>

<p>“I’m taking her back to the Rock,” Jaime warned. “With me.”</p>

<p>It all reached her ears with a strange, muffled quality. Like she wasn’t there, not really.</p>

<p>“No, you’re not,” and this time Robert’s voice was not just a void menace. No, this time she felt him grab her by the arm. Jaime held onto her. Like a rag doll, only half alive, she tried to wrench free of Robert’s grasp, but she wasn’t strong enough. “She’s not going anywhere.”</p>

<p>Jaime’s arms suddenly abandoned her, as did Robert’s hand. In a blink of an eye, Jaime pounced, feline. He grabbed Robert by his lapel, pushed him and stepped between him and Cersei. Robert stumbled backwards, taken aback, but only for a couple steps. It took him half a second to recover, and return to a vigilant position.</p>

<p>“Jaime, don’t,” Cersei hissed, wrapping her arms around his waist, trying to hold him back. He wasn’t listening to her, he wasn’t listening to reason. “Jaime, please, let’s go,” she tried again.</p>

<p>Robert took a step forward. “Tell her,” he said then, ominous. “Tell her what you did, Jaime. See if she still loves you, then.”</p>

<p>Cersei shot him a scathing look, tried to step in front of Jaime and get him to look at her. “Let’s go,” she said, her voice beginning to sound panicked. “Let’s go Jaime, please,” her hands were feverish at his neck. He was lost.</p>

<p>“Tell her, Jaime,” Robert said again.</p>

<p>Jaime leapt. In spite of Cersei’s attempts to stop him, he leapt, strong as she was, hurled himself against Robert’s sturdy frame and tackled him. They both fell with a heavy thud. Robert’s head hit the ground, he howled, but it didn’t stop him. Jaime was atop him, straddling him, hands tight around his neck. Robert’s gargles sent a shiver up Cersei’s spine.</p>

<p>“Jaime, stop!” she yelled, this time. “Jaime!”</p>

<p>Her voice distracted him and he turned to look at her: briefly, with the messy hair in his eyes he looked like a child, lost, unsure of what to do next. That mistake lost him his lead. Robert managed to shrug him off, forced him on his back, turning things around. Cersei saw Robert’s fisted hand rise and fall on Jaime’s face. She saw the blood spurt from his bottom lip at the first punch, from his cheekbone on the second one.</p>

<p><em>No.</em></p>

<p>As Robert’s fist rose a third time, she sprung to action. Unaware of her own movements, she threw herself at Robert. She grabbed his arm with all her might, tried to keep him from hitting Jaime again. “Goddamnit, woman,” Robert groaned, and all but pushed her away as you would flick a dead fly. She posed no threat for him. She stumbled, fell back, hit the table with her side as she did and saw searing white behind her eyelids for a moment.</p>

<p>Jaime tried to reach for her, but Robert held him there, on the floor. As she held her side, she saw Jaime’s blood seeping into the wood. <em>Her blood.</em> She reached up, for the table, and her fingers closed around something sharp, something cold. Robert hit Jaime a third time. As the beating went on, Jaime seemed to respond with less vigor. Terror had taken hold of her.</p>

<p>She crawled, on all fours, wincing until the pain subsided. That was when Robert’s fourth blow hit Jaime’s jaw. Jaime’s face was bloody, his bottom lip purple.</p>

<p>She stood, on her knees.</p>

<p>Robert never saw it coming.</p>

<p>Never saw <em>her</em> coming.</p>

<p>Her arm snaked around his neck, she held the blade at his throat and sliced. As deep as she could reach. She felt the skin tear, the muscle, she hit the bone. It was swift, yet she felt Robert’s blood spill on her hand, warm, and all over Jaime’s chest. She could not tell which was Jaime’s and which was Robert’s.</p>

<p>Her husband’s attempts at holding his neck were futile. The blood was spilling from the wound, onto his desperate hands, all over his shirt. He fell, sideways, almost graceful. He kicked his legs a couple times, body shaken by singults. He gargled, in the attempt to say something, but his words died inside his sliced throat, flowing out with the blood.</p>

<p>It took some time, but eventually he stopped moving. Cersei was sitting on her heels, looking at what was left of the man she’d married. A carcass, a shell.</p>

<p>Jaime propped himself on his elbows, breathing hard. He groaned, crawled away from Robert’s corpse, spit out the blood in his mouth. Then he allowed himself to look at her. In spite of the black she’d worn, one could see her sleeve was covered in blood, as were her hands.</p>

<p>Cersei glanced down, frowned and dropped the silver knife.</p>

<p>Her heart was thumping in her ears, like it was about to explode.</p>

<p>“Jaime?” she breathed. </p>

<p><em>Now what?</em></p>

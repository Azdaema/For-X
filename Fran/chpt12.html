<p>For her 30th birthday, Robert had given her a black convertible Mercedes, which Cersei had driven three times in her life. The first time had been the day she got the keys. London and its traffic weren’t suited for fast cars, so she’d driven it all the way to Storm’s End. She wasn’t much of a driver, most of her life she’d had people driving her around – but even Cersei couldn’t deny it was a nice car and a nice gift. Back than Robert did not hate her half as much as he did now, and viceversa.</p>

<p>The second time around had been to go to the emergency room the night her parents died. The ride had not been half as pleasant as the first one. She could still remember the sense of oppression mixed with something new – grief. By the time she had reached the hospital, her father was dead. Her mother was comatose and would die later that night. She had not been in any condition to drive after that, she’d called a cab home, and sent someone to get the car the following morning.</p>

<p>The third time was after Robert’s election. She left early in the morning with nothing but her cell phone and some pounds. She had tied her hair up in a loose ponytail and, for the first time in a long time, she’d work jeans and a white t-shirt, in the attempt to keep a low profile <em>and</em> because she was nowhere near her right state of mind.</p>

<p>Jaime called what she did <em>dolling up</em>. She considered it armour.</p>

<p>There was so much Jaime would never understand. Because he was a man, first and foremost, and because he was… well, Jaime. A privileged, rich white boy who had never struggled for anything. Who was used to always getting what he wanted. Who never asked please because no one had ever taught him.</p>

<p>This time, though, it would not be that easy. The thing he wanted was well beyond his reach.</p>

<p>Castamere was not quite as big as Storm’s End or Casterly Rock. In fact, upon returning for the first time in ten years, Cersei realized how small it looked compared to the places she’d been, the things she’d seen. There, as she waited for the gate to open, looking at the villa, she felt like an outsider. This had been her home until she was 11, but then she had gone to boarding school. On Christmases the Reynes liked to travel; so she’d spent Christmas in Casablanca, San Francisco, Tokyo, Sydney and many more places, but never <em>home</em>.</p>

<p>Though in all fairness she’d begun to question the same idea of <em>home</em>. Why did home have to be a place? Perhaps it could be a person.</p>

<p>Her phone rang at the same time as the gate opened, so she ignored it. Ignored the texts that followed as well, pulling up into the driveway. She got out, leaving the keys in the ignition because no one would ever set foot in Castamere. It was a cage. A beautiful gilded cage. Before she got out, however, she grabbed her phone and glanced at the screen.</p>

<p>Cersei put the phone in her pocket and slammed the car door shut. When she reached the main door, she found a woman she recognized waiting on the threshold. Her hair was light brown and shorter than Cersei remembered, a sharp bob cut that was shorter at the back and longer at the front. She wore straight black pants and a white blouse. It looked like she was on her way to work.</p>

<p>“Hi,” Cersei said, waiting at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>Ellyn, the eldest of Roger Reyne’s daughters, was not happy to see her.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Cersei?”</p>

<p>Cersei could understand the hostility. Ever since the big reveal, the Reyne family had not exactly had bad press. There had been countless articles on why Roger Reyne would accept Tywin Lannister’s offer, speculation that he needed money for gambling debts or worse. They had dug into the Reyne’s past like vultures and, as it often happens, when you look hard enough you’re bound to find something. So it turned out Roger Reyne liked young boys. Very young boys. Too young.</p>

<p>One might have said it was a blessing he only ever had daughters.</p>

<p>“I need somewhere to think,” Cersei said. She had never asked for permission to her own sisters, but things were different now. Ellyn was not her sister, and this was not her house. Although they had been, both, for a long time.</p>

<p>Ellyn was weighing her options. She was never cruel. Rigid, yes. Stuck-up, definitely. And she would never pass up the chance to lord the situation over Cersei’s head. “Take off your shoes.” With that, Ellyn went back into the house, leaving the door open for Cersei. Looking down, she noticed she was standing in mud, and her sneakers were a mess.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing Cersei noticed upon entering her childhood bedroom was… it was not a bedroom anymore. Back in the days the walls had been white and pink, and the carpeted floor a bright salmon. Someone had scraped the childish wallpaper and painted the walls beige. The room was filled with boxes that no one had bothered to close with some tape. She walked in, and the first thing she did was draw the curtains, open the window and let the light in. She watched the fine dust float for a little while, as the room breathed and lived again.</p>

<p>She approached the boxes, sat on the floor and opened the first one: inside, she found her dolls. Old, quite ugly too, hardly played with. No matter how many dolls her father used to buy for her, she would always want something bigger, something better, or something shinier. Something that wasn’t there, that didn’t exist. All her life she wanted something but she didn’t know what.</p>

<p>In the next box she found old pictures, drawings that she had hung up on the wall and things she had written when she was less than 6: letters to Santa, requests to her parents, war declarations to Ellyn, or Alys or, more often, to Rohanne, her least favourite sister. Those made her chuckle: she had been combative even back then, fighting to find her own place in a world that did not feel like hers. That was not, in fact, hers.</p>

<p>Gentle footsteps distracted her from the contents of the boxes. Ellyn appeared upon the threshold shortly after. From her position, Ellyn looked taller and magnificent; Cersei felt small and out of place.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what to do with your things,” Ellyn explained, gesturing to the boxes. “I figured you might want to get them back now that…” She trailed off. Cersei knew what she referred to, and nodded a silent thank you. “Congratulations, by the way.”</p>

<p>Cersei hesitated. “For Robert or the rest?” <em>The rest</em> was certainly one way of referring to a secret family.</p>

<p>“Both? I think both.”</p>

<p>Her phone rang twice in her pocket. She took it out, read the texts.</p>

<p> Cersei bit her bottom lip and turned off her phone, deciding London could wait. Robert, Jaime, the whole lot of them. She needed a moment. She needed a fucking moment. A few strands fell into her eyes and she tried to stick them behind her ear. It was cold in the room; Cersei peeked at the radiator and wondered when they’d last switched it on in this room.</p>

<p>“Are you spending the night?” Ellyn asked, still as cold as Cersei remembered. Ellyn had been a grown woman when she was still a child, adult when she was supposed to be child. Mature, responsible. Insufferable.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” Cersei said truthfully. “Where’s my bed?”</p>

<p>“I figured you wouldn’t need it,” Ellyn said, not the faintest trace of a smile on her lips. “You wouldn’t fit in anyway, you’ve grown taller.” Cersei hugged her legs, her subconscious warning her against her sister’s subtle psychological warfare. “You can sleep in the guestroom.”</p>

<p>Cersei’s eyes went to one of the boxes again, and something caught her attention. Ellyn was about to leave, but Cersei was quicker. “Ellyn, wait. What is this?” she asked, showing her a picture drawn by a child.</p>

<p>Ellyn squinted to look at it. “I think that’s Ser Pounce.” Cersei had no idea what Ellyn was talking about, and perhaps it showed because Ellyn laughed at her confusion. “You really don’t remember? He was your imaginary friend.”</p>

<p>Cersei frowned, looking at the drawing. “No, I don’t,” she said, astounded. “I really don’t.” There she was, in the picture, standing next to a young boy with blonde hair, green eyes and a red bowtie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ellyn did not go to work that day. She was a lawyer, a <em>good</em> lawyer. Good enough to have her own firm and make her own rules. Even though she did not exactly hang around, Cersei knew she was the reason Ellyn had decided to stay home: was it residual affection, or lack of trust? That, she couldn’t tell. Still, she spent most of the morning tending to her plants in the greenhouse.</p>

<p>Cersei was on the couch, looking into the fireplace when the doorbell rang, around noon. Cersei put down her tea, went to stand and open the door but Ellyn beat her to it. She was still half sitting when she heard Alys’ voice. “Is she here?” She sounded angry.</p>

<p>Ellyn kept her voice low, so Cersei couldn’t tell exactly what was said between them, but next thing she knew Alys Reyne had entered the room, visibly pregnant and unhappy. “Cersei.” Her hair was lighter than Ellyn’s, longer and plainer, dull. As was her face. The middle child. “What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Cersei greeted, matching her sister’s coldness. “I just needed to get away from…”</p>

<p><em>Him. Myself.</em> For a moment she wanted to leave Cersei Lannister behind and go back to being Cersei Reyne, when her problems had been so much smaller, insignificant even.</p>

<p>Alys was angry, but Cersei knew she wasn’t being rational; she may blame her for what had happened to Roger Reyne now, but only because the person she should blame was no longer alive to take it. Cersei knew that feeling well: if Tywin were alive, she wasn’t sure how she might have reacted.</p>

<p>“Come on,” Ellyn was doing her best to keep an apparent peace. “I’ll make some tea.”</p>

<p>Ellyn disappeared into the kitchen, while Cersei and Alys remained in the dining room. Neither spoke for a while, especially Alys, who kept avoiding Cersei’s proximity.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were pregnant,” Cersei said, tentatively. They both sat down on the couch, at the opposite ends. Cersei’s hands were in her lap, and she didn’t truly know what to do with them. Weird enough, she desperately wanted to touch her sister’s belly.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot you don’t know.”</p>

<p>The fact she’d answered was a step forward from the silent treatment she’d expected. “How far along are you?” Cersei asked then, pushing her luck.</p>

<p>Alys shot her a look, sideways, then looked away immediately, like she was afraid Cersei might see it as a weakness. “Eight and a half. Almost there.”</p>

<p>Cersei hadn’t given children much thought recently. Well, at first she’d considered the possibility, back when she still felt any sort of affection for Robert. In the first few years of their marriage they had tried without any luck. Robert had suggested she should get tested, but the results had come back negative. Cersei had earned herself a slap just for suggesting he do the same. Time had passed, and in spite of their attempts month after month she kept getting her period. Robert was growing impatient and began to blame her, which only made her furious and less willing to have children at all. After a few years, they stopped trying. Cersei thought that had been the beginning of Robert’s resentment – that was until she’d found out about Lyanna Stark.</p>

<p>“I don’t have any,” she told Alys for some reason.</p>

<p>Alys looked at her now, defiantly. “You wouldn’t be much of a mother, really.”</p>

<p>Alys was sharp as a knife, and she always knew which buttons to push to hurt you the most. Because she was small, and undoubtedly the most fragile among them, she had developed a certain cruelty. Cersei couldn’t tell if she despised of admired her. “Can’t disagree with that,” she said, sitting on the edge of the couch and stretching out her arm to warm her hands by the fire. “How’s Rohanne?”</p>

<p>“Fine. Married an American tycoon. Lives in Florida now.”</p>

<p>“Ugh, Florida?” Cersei grimaced. “Gross.”</p>

<p>Alys laughed, but it was short. When Cersei turned, she was looking around, like it was shameful to laugh at what she had said. Cersei knew Alys well enough: she did not want to be the first one to bury the hatchet.</p>

<p>In that moment, she reminded her of Jaime, and her heart sank a little. The reason for this trip was to get away from all that, yet it seemed she was unable to just drop it. It lived inside her now, she carried it with her like heavy luggage. Flashes of that night: his hands, his lips, his voice, his breath hot on her neck.</p>

<p>“Tea’s ready!”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It started to rain in the early afternoon, and it didn’t stop until the sky was dark and night had fallen. No stars, no moon, just a black canvas covering the whole region. As if Cersei’s mood needed any of that. Alys and Ellyn were trying to stay out of her hair, and she was trying to stay out of theirs. They could not exactly kick her out – well, technically, yes since she was no longer one of them. But they didn’t, and her way of showing gratitude was to lock herself in her room, going through her things to keep her mind occupied.</p>

<p>But she was failing. She had run out of things to think about in place of the one thing she should not think about ever. Jaime was seeping through her thoughts more frequently now, forcing her to come to terms with what had happened. He had <em>kissed</em> her. She had <em>kissed</em> him. Why was that so much worse than what had happened on the night of their birthday? Well – they were sober, the both of them.</p>

<p>And there had been <em>contact</em>, proper contact. Their bodies had been pressed together, she’d had a chance to feel what she had only fantasized about. Fantasies were a loan for use deal. There was no effective price but for their soul.</p>

<p>This was different, though. Jaime was her brother, and she had kissed him, he had kissed her and the only reason she had stopped was… Why? Because it had suddenly become too real. Kissing could be considered a mistake, naivety. But what was about to happen… it was illegal. If anyone were to find out, their lives would be over.</p>

<p>Oh, but she was so close to giving in.</p>

<p>A knock on the door. Ellyn’s voice. “Can I come in?”</p>

<p>The latest box she had found held some old t-shirts that were not her style anymore. She had donned a Jack Daniel’s shirt just to see what she would look like today. It still fit, but it wasn’t the <em>right fit</em> in a sense. She was not that person anymore. Ellyn opened the door and the shirt Cersei was wearing was the first thing she noticed. “Why are you wearing that?”</p>

<p>Cersei took it off, folded it and put it back in the box.</p>

<p>Ellyn waited on the threshold, but once it was clear Cersei would not give her much more she let herself in and closed the door behind her. With her back against the wall, she slid all the way to the floor, crossing her legs. Cersei found it atypical of her, Miss Perfect.</p>

<p>“So…” Ellyn started. “How are they?”</p>

<p>“Who are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Your brothers.”</p>

<p>Cersei took a deep breath and sat down on one of the boxes, the one that looked more solid. “They’re fine.”</p>

<p>Ellyn rolled her eyes. “Is that it? Really? <em>Fine</em>?”</p>

<p>Cersei shrugged. “What do you want me to say? They’re my brothers. When we’re together, it feels right. In a way it never did with you.” Cersei liked hard truths better than sugar-coated lies. In that sense, Ellyn and she were the same. In fact, her “sister” smiled in acknowledgement. “Tyrion is… the funniest man I have ever met. He’s wild, but smart and kind. Kind in a way I could never be.”</p>

<p>“And what about Jaime Lannister? London’s most desirable bachelor.”</p>

<p>Cersei’s fingers tightened in her knees, fingernails scraping the jeans. Ellyn was waiting for an answer, and it would look suspicious to make her wait. But her stomach was in knots and it was getting harder to breathe. “He makes me whole.”</p>

<p>And that was the whole truth, at last, spoken before someone who had become a stranger.</p>

<p>Ellyn’s small smile faltered at that. Cersei noticed and hurried to stand up and look away. “I’ll have someone pick these up in the morning.” Ellyn pushed herself off the floor, wiped some dust from her pants and nodded. She was uncomfortable, and so was Cersei. “I have to make a phone call, excuse me.”</p>

<p>Ellyn did not say anything more after that, but before she left the room the pair exchanged a look that was filled with all the words they had never said, and all the ones they were too scared to say. Cersei wondered if Ellyn was warning her, if she knew and was using her eternal wisdom to try and dissuade her from whatever mess she’d gotten herself into.</p>

<p>When she turned on her phone, it started buzzing like crazy with all she had missed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Her heart stopped when she read that word. What did it mean? Dread took over, and her hands began to shake as she dialled Jaime’s phone number. It went straight to voicemail. She swallowed, looking at the screen, considering her options. She dialled Tyrion’s number next, but she was already out of the room, her feet guiding her in the middle of her panic.</p>

<p>When Tyrion answered, his voice was low, a whisper. “Where the fuck are you?”</p>

<p>“What happened?” She was running down the stairs now, completely unaware of her surroundings, going through it like you would a dream. <em>A nightmare.</em></p>

<p>“Jaime was in a car accident.” She halted. <em>He’s alive,</em> she thought. <em>If he were dead I would know it.</em> But Tyrion’s voice betrayed him. “They’re doing everything they can.” His voice broke for the fraction of a second, and that was perhaps the thing that scared her the most.</p>

<p>She ran out the door, leaving the door open. Ellyn was on the threshold, looking in confusion as Cersei all but jumped into the car and started the ignition. She pressed her foot on the gas pedal, and the tires screeched as she changed gears and went in reverse, all the way down the pathway. With a sharp U-turn, she sped up through the open gates, hands gripping the steering wheel, feeling half dead herself.</p>

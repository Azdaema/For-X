<p>The light teal of her bedroom ceiling in Storm’s End had never been more hideous, it hurt her eyes. She remembered picking that colour when she was twenty-three years old and thinking to herself, <em>I’ll wake up to this for the rest of my life.</em> She had been married for twelve days. The light teal had seemed a bold choice, now she wished she’d picked something more vivid that would help her feel… something. Everything, about that house, reminded her that she was dying by the minute.</p>

<p>July 18th, her thirty-ninth birthday. One year before the big one. Yet time had stopped ever since she’d met him.</p>

<p>It was his birthday as well. She realized that was something she had not thought about ever since their return, one week earlier. Tenerife had changed everything.</p>

<p>They had not spoken again, in London. Things were tense, they had said and done and seen too many things to ever be able to go back. Still, she missed him; missed the warmth that came with his embraces, missed the way he looked at her like she was perfect. Robert didn’t help, in that sense. The very few times they were together he looked at her with such disdain – he never touched her, but he rued her for everything: for telling her brother about his blows, for denouncing him and exposing him to someone who could actually shield her.</p>

<p>Robert hated that she wasn’t vulnerable anymore, that he couldn’t use and abuse her and remain unpunished. There would be consequences from now on. The way he saw it, she thought, he’d lost his favourite toy.</p>

<p>She went downstairs around noon, still in her nightgown, and the help smiled profusely, wishing her a happy birthday. She waved her hands, and “Please, don’t,” without attempting at politeness. Cersei hated her birthday, hated growing old and being reminded of it. She hated the thin lines that had begun to appear, unwelcomed, and the white hair that she knew hid in her golden mane.</p>

<p>“Mrs Baratheon.” Cersei turned and saw one of Robert’s men standing in the doorway, holding the biggest bouquet she had ever seen, and a bottle of wine with a red ribbon on it. Red roses. “This came for you,” he explained, and handed it to her.</p>

<p>Cersei counted them: thirty-nine. There was a note, hidden in the foliage.</p>

<blockquote class="notecard">
	<p>Drink up, you’re old!<br />–Tyrion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What was that, in the pit of her stomach? Disappointment? Sadness? Had she truly thought the roses would be from Jaime, instead? And why did it let her down this much that it was not him? Cersei glanced at the wine, then handed it to one of the maids. “Pour me a glass of this.” The young girl hesitated, her eyes fleeting to the grandfather clock nearby. “Did I stutter?” Cersei pressed on, and the girl scurried off.</p>

<p>About ten minutes later she was nursing the glass of wine, sitting in Robert’s study, deep in thought. There had been a lot of that recently, just sitting around and thinking, reconsidering the things that had happened in Tenerife, and before that as well. There were considerations to be made.</p>

<p>Fact: Jaime Lannister was her brother. Biologically, legally, morally.</p>

<p>Fact: Jaime Lannister loved her – like any brother would.</p>

<p>Fact: Jaime Lannister was the most handsome man she had ever laid eyes on.</p>

<p>Fact: Jaime Lannister was the part of her she did not know was missing.</p>

<p>Cersei looked down into her glass.</p>

<p>Problem: she wanted to fuck Jaime Lannister.</p>

<p>She downed the whole of the wine in one gulp.</p>

<p>Her mind went back to her night with Addam. The boy had been eager to please, and his cock did not lack substance, nor was he half a bad lover. Perhaps he was anxious, pressured to perform; Cersei knew he’d wanted her ever since their Oxford days. When it had happened at last, it hadn’t made her feel anything. Not until Jaime had walked in. Cersei had given up on the concept of orgasm during sex, consigning it to solo sessions only. No man had ever managed the task her own fingers were so used to performing. But Jaime…</p>

<p>Jaime had walked in and with his presence alone he had pinned her to that wall and brought her somewhere she had never been before. As Addam fucked her, and her eyes had locked with Jaime’s, it had been easy to change up the scenario. To think about him doing the same, his hands where Addam’s were, his mouth where Addam’s was, his cock where Addam’s was. Her body, her mind had done the rest.</p>

<p>Cersei could not stop thinking about it. As she poured a second glass, she found herself mulling it over in her head once again, becoming flustered. And she might have needed to take care of it if she hadn’t been interrupted by the slamming of the entrance door, and Robert’s heavy footsteps down the corridor.</p>

<p>“Up at last?” he asked, waltzing in. He was wearing a fitted black suit, a bit tight on the shoulders. He wasn’t that bad-looking, not that morning. She could almost remember the man she had married. He looked at the open bottle and the glass in her hand. “Partying already, I see.” He approached, kissed her cheek. “Happy birthday.” Her skin crawled. With each passing day, it was harder and harder to stand the man before her, his hands on her, his breath, his voice, the smell of his cologne. “Isn’t it a bit early in the day?” he asked, innocently. He was a functioning alcoholic, which substantially meant he drank enough but hid it well.</p>

<p>“Tyrion thinks I don’t drink enough, apparently,” she explained, showing him the note from her brother. Robert looked at it and laughed, giving it back. “Robert, do I really have to do this–”</p>

<p>“Don’t start, Cersei,” Robert went behind his desk and sat down, pulling up a folder from somewhere. Cersei managed reading the label before he could put it down and cover it: it read <em>Aerys</em>. What did Robert want with Aerys Targaryen? The old man had been dead for the best part of the last ten years now. “You know it’s not about your birthday as much as it is politics,” he said easily. “It’s about establishing connections. Speaking of, have you told your brothers?”</p>

<p>Cersei tucked her legs underneath her, and rested her head against her hand. “Not yet… I mean, it’s Jaime’s birthday as well, he probably has better plans than sitting around with your boring band of bickering buffoons.”</p>

<p>Robert linked his hands over the folder, watched her. “Alliteration, nice.” Cersei narrowed her eyes at him, wondering if he had just learned what alliteration was. “If I remember correctly, you went behind my back with the whole Secretary affair. Tyrion better be there, the whole cabinet is going to be there.” Cersei wanted to spite him, to remind him he wasn’t the Prime Minister yet therefore he did not have a cabinet: all he had was a group of belligerent idiots, and now one of her brothers as well. “As for Jaime, I honestly could not care less where he is.”</p>

<p>Cersei tilted her head, wishing she cared as little as he did. “I’ll talk to them,” she said finally. She could taste the wine on her lips.</p>

<p>“You can go,” he said, looking down and opening the folder in front of him. As a second thought, he looked up and raised an eyebrow. His eyes trailed down her body, to the spot where her nightgown left her thighs bare. “Unless you’re here for something else.”</p>

<p>Cersei snorted, picked up the bottle and stood up. “Don’t embarrass yourself.” She headed for the door, but could feel him seething behind her. “I got you a gift, you know?” he said before she could open the door.</p>

<p>With her hand on the doorknob, she glanced over her shoulder. “I’m sure you did, Robert.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She had reserved a table for three at the Seven Park Place restaurant in Mayfair. The place was tastefully decorated, golden Asian-fusion influences everywhere she looked. She had arrived first, asked their table on the sideways to ensure more privacy. Outside, by the door, were two of Robert’s men. She had ordered a flute of champagne while she waited, and she was almost done with it when she saw Tyrion making his way towards the table.</p>

<p>“You’re late,” she said, dry.</p>

<p>“Traffic was awful,” he apologized, kissing her cheek and sitting down.</p>

<p>She pursed her lips together, attempted at feigning indifference. “Jaime…?”</p>

<p>Tyrion sighed, bit his bottom lip and shook his head. “He won’t be joining us today,” he said, and he looked very uncomfortable as he did.</p>

<p>Desperate to keep her hands busy, she attempted to fix the napkin on her plate even though it needed no fixing. She nodded, to him and herself, and swallowed the bitterness. “I would have liked to wish him a happy birthday.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you call him?”</p>

<p>“I tried,” Cersei drawled, then continued through gritted teeth. “He won’t pick up.”</p>

<p>Tyrion picked up the menu, and sent her one last look over the edge before he disappeared behind it completely, a sign that he had no intention of having that conversation with her. “I know William,” he added then, looking around. “He’s the chef here.” Cersei looked down at the fists in her lap. She felt angry beyond words that Jaime would pull a stunt like that, and on her birthday nonetheless. “So, you wanted to see me?”</p>

<p>Cersei sighed and decided to push Jaime aside for the time being. Perhaps she’d worry about him later, or never. “Robert’s throwing a… birthday dinner.” Her words were coated in venom. “He’s invited some friends over, and insists you should be there.” Tyrion fell silent, looked at her and Cersei was sure he was looking at her soul. “What?”</p>

<p>“It’s an odd request,” Tyrion said, putting down the menu. “It is Jaime’s birthday as well. Is he invited?”</p>

<p>“Of course he is, but… as you can see, he doesn’t seem interested.” It was hard not to show resentment. “Robert doesn’t care for Jaime. You, on the other hand? He was adamant you should be there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see now. So it’s not about your birthday at all.”</p>

<p>Cersei lifted a hand to call the waiter and cut the conversation short. “Another flute,” she said, when the boy was within ear’s reach. “And…?”</p>

<p>“A Bloody Mary will be fine,” Tyrion told the boy, who left for the bar. Tyrion leaned back into the padded bench and shook his head. “You deserve better, you know? You could divorce him. I know the best divorce lawyer in town.”</p>

<p>“How do you know what I deserve?” Cersei asked, emptying the flute. “You don’t know me.”</p>

<p>“True. But surely anyone deserves better than that, love.”</p>

<p>It felt oddly patronizing, and Cersei wasn’t sure she liked it. There was a difference in how Jaime and Tyrion treated her, clear as day. Tyrion treated her like a child sometimes, even though she was older than him. Not to mention, there was a coldness to him still, a calculated lucid detachment. Like he expected her to draw fangs. Jaime was the opposite: when she thought about him she thought of a scalding light, a vivacious jealousy, a terrible love.</p>

<p>Cersei straightened her back and cleared her throat, head tilted to the side as she tried to assess the damage his words had done. <em>Divorce.</em> Of course she had thought about it, she had thought about it the first time he’d laid hands on her. Back then Roger Reyne had still been alive, but she had only told Ellyn, her older sister. <em>Hit back,</em> her sister had said, but never had she mentioned she should leave him. No, the union with the Baratheon family was too good to give up.</p>

<p>“Are you coming or not?” Cersei asked, changing the subject back to neutral territory.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to speak to Jaime.”</p>

<p>The waiter arrived with the drinks they had ordered, put them down one by one and left with a small bow of his head. Cersei barely touched the stem of her glass, offered him a small smile and nodded.</p>

<p>“You know,” Tyrion began after a generous sip of his Blood Mary. “He won’t speak to me either. I mean we live together but it’s like living with a ghost, you know?” That made her look up, and she saw a pain in her brother’s eyes. Perhaps it was a different pain – but it was pain all the same. “I am… positively terrified to ask this, Cersei, but I have to. Did something happen?”</p>

<p>Cersei swallowed, watched the tiny bubbles come up to the surface in her glass. “We… had an argument, that’s all.” She smiled politely, fake. “Oh, look, there’s William! Let’s order, I’m famished.” Tyrion’s concerned stare remained on her for a while longer, but for the rest of their lunch neither mentioned Jaime again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robert’s birthday present rested on her neckline, a heavy golden necklace with beautiful emerald drops. Cersei admired the glimmer in the reflection, holding her hair up to decide whether it would look better with a ponytail or down in curls. She’d worn a red dress, tight in the right places, with an asymmetric décolletage that bared her right shoulder.</p>

<p>“It looks beautiful.”</p>

<p>Cersei spun around to see her husband entering her bedroom. “And how do <em>I</em> look?”</p>

<p>Robert looked her over, up and down. “I think you know how you look.” Cersei smirked and returned her undivided attention to the full length mirror. Barefooted, she stood quite shorter than him, and it was only more evident when he came up behind her in his grey tuxedo, white shirt and lucid black shoes. He slid his hands up her arms and halted at her shoulders, where his fingers toyed with the emeralds. Cersei let her hair down, and met his hungry eyes in the mirror. “You should leave it down. It makes you look human,” he said at last.</p>

<p>Cersei tensed up. He was grinning now, his face half hidden in her hair while he sniffed her. <em>You will not smell fear.</em> “Is that what your friends are supposed to see me as?” she asked. “Human? Will that make them more… ah, sympathetic towards you?”</p>

<p>Robert chuckled and kissed her temple. “I don’t need them sympathetic. I need them to wish they could fuck you.”</p>

<p>A backhanded compliment, Cersei guessed. Robert walked away and she grabbed the brush. “Marcia?” she called out, and soon enough a short woman appeared in the doorway. “I need you to brush my hair, and do the tightest, highest hairdo you’ve ever done.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was an atmosphere of solemnity in the big saloon of Storm’s End. Robert and Eddard had disappeared in her husband’s study some time before, leaving her to play the gracious host to people she wanted to kick outside her home. Robert’s youngest brother had introduced them to his young new lover, a boy, the youngest son of Mace Tyrell. The middle Baratheon brother was present as well, with his horse-faced, boring wife. Thankfully Selyse was too busy catching up with Catelyn Tully to bother Cersei. Varys was there, of course, as he always was, lurking about and listening in on most conversations – she made a mental note of asking him, later.</p>

<p>The most surprising visitor had been Petyr Baelish, whom Cersei did not remember being part of Robert’s inner circle. Baelish was a dangerous, sleazy individual, a man of many secrets – too many. Why was he there and what did he know?</p>

<p>The doorbell rang just as Cersei was about to burst in Robert’s study and drag him back out to entertain his guests. Cersei waited for the help to escort the guests that had just arrived, and she wore a small smile because she knew who it would be. But when Marcia returned, she was accompanied by Tyrion. Alone. Cersei’s lips opened just enough to exhale.</p>

<p>The other guests had fallen silent the moment Tyrion had waltzed in. Stannis especially was particularly red in the face, grinding his teeth. Cersei had heard from Robert that he was supposed to occupy the role she had arbitrarily assigned to her own brother.</p>

<p>“Why the long faces,” Tyrion tried to joke, handing his coat away. “Is this any proper way to celebrate this beautiful lady?” He approached her, kissed her cheek and whispered in her ear, “I tried. He wouldn’t budge.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t stay with him?”</p>

<p>“We got in a fight. He told me to fuck off.”</p>

<p>Stannis Baratheon stood up from his armchair by the fireplace, resisting his wife’s attempt to hold him back. “I won’t just stand idly by,” he started off addressing the others, everyone except for Cersei and Tyrion. “How can you all just accept this?”</p>

<p>Renly Baratheon chuckled, lifted a glass his way. “You act as if we have a choice.”</p>

<p>Varys cleared his throat. “If I may, I think Mr. Lannister can only contribute positively to Robert’s campaign.”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t know you don’t have any I’d say she has got you by the balls,” Stannis growled, pointing a finger at Cersei.</p>

<p>“Careful Stannis,” Tyrion warned.</p>

<p>The fact that Tyrion had dared addressing him was outrageous to Stannis. Cersei watched the exchange without saying a word; men and their toys, the idea amused her infinitely. And to know Stannis was so afraid of her, it made her feel a drop of triumph. She sneered, green eyes sparkling in the gentle light that came from the fireplace.</p>

<p>“I don’t like you, Tyrion,” Stannis said. “I don’t like your brother. I didn’t like your father. And I most definitely do not like her.” Cersei chuckled to herself, which only inflamed him further. “My brother doesn’t see what you are. I do.”</p>

<p>“And what am I, Stannis?” Cersei said at last, all eyes on them now.</p>

<p>“You do not love my brother. You don’t love anyone. I don’t think you’re even capable of that,” Stannis’ voice was grave, like he was sentencing her to death.</p>

<p>Cersei knew Stannis well enough to know it wasn’t the job he had lost that bothered him – in fact, Robert had lost no time and given him another of almost equal importance. No, what Stannis hated was the fact she did not play fair. He was rigorous, stern. Cersei represented everything he hated: temptation, sin, and the embodiment of his brother’s weakness.</p>

<p>“What’s going on?” came Robert’s thunderous voice from the doorway. Behind him, Eddard Stark looked from Cersei to Stannis, then back to Cersei. “Not you two again.”</p>

<p>“Robert, I wish to speak to you about this… ridiculous affair.”</p>

<p>Eddard and Robert exchanged a look, then her husband took a step forward into the room. “Not now. There’s something we need to discuss first.” Cersei had never seen Robert so tense, so she stood up slowly. Tyrion kept his position by her side, as everyone else walked closer. Robert looked around, pointedly, at each and every one of his guests. “Jon Arryn is stepping down.”</p>

<p>A clamour, suddenly. “What!” “Why?” “What the fuck?” “What is going on?” “What does that mean?”</p>

<p>Cersei remained silent for the longest while. She knew what that meant. It meant Robert had spoken to the Party. It meant they had agreed he would be the successor. Elections would be held in due time, but no one had any doubts he would win those as well. He would become Prime Minister. She would become…</p>

<p>“Congratulations,” Tyrion grabbed her hand and pulled at it lightly, dragging her from her trance. While everyone else was congratulating Robert, Tyrion seemed more interested in what she had to say. Eventually Robert appeared before her and planted a kiss on her lips. For a moment all hatred was forgiven, and everyone felt like celebrating. She was quite stunned at how fast this was happening, but the euphoria was getting to her.</p>

<p>It had all been worth it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The green dress lay discarded by her bed. In her nightgown, Cersei looked once more at the ceiling. The same horrid light teal. She decided she would repaint the room. What for, though, when she would be moving to Downing Street soon enough. The guests had left, Robert had left the house to go out with Stannis and celebrate. Even Tyrion had been giddy, eager to start the new adventure.</p>

<p>Her phone rang, there, on her nightstand, as she was applying moisturizer to her neck. And then, just as she was thinking she could have it all…</p>

<p>“I hear congratulations are in order.” His voice. His <em>stupid</em> voice. “Tyrion told me you’re going to be the wife of the Prime Minister. That’s awfully fancy.”</p>

<p>Cersei felt the blood rising to her cheeks. “You do like cutting it awfully close.”</p>

<p>“Go to the window.”</p>

<p>Cersei stood up and did as he told her to. She pushed aside the curtain and sure enough, just outside the gate, she saw a black car with tinted windows. The backseat window rolled down and she saw him lift a hand and wave. “11.58 pm… Happy birthday.”</p>

<p>“You’re an asshole,” She heard the deep sigh on the other end, saw him sink into the leather seat. He looked dishevelled, his bowtie crooked, his hair messy. “Are you drunk?”</p>

<p>“Not enough.”</p>

<p>“Robert isn’t here,” she said. “Come in.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” he drawled.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You know why, Cers.” She leaned against the window frame, her phone pressed to her ear like it was a lifeline. They were silent, but breathing hard. She blessed him for being stronger than she was. He continued. “I… can’t help it. I’ve read about it. Children are separated for whatever reason and then… they see each other when they’re adults and… It happens, sometimes.” His voice was strangely clear for someone as drunk as he was. The worst thing was, he was making sense.</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> happens, Jaime?”</p>

<p>She needed him to say it.</p>

<p>He groaned. She couldn’t really make out his face from that distance, but she knew his eyes were closed, she could almost picture him biting his bottom lip in the attempt not to spill too much of his deepest secrets.</p>

<p>Or perhaps she was just projecting.</p>

<p>“I want to touch you, all the time. I want to touch your legs, your stomach, your back... I want to touch your face, remember every little crevice of you.” His voice had dropped an octave. “I want to know what it’s like to be held by you like you held <em>him</em>. That’s why I didn’t leave, that night.”</p>

<p>Slowly, her fingers had crept down her own thigh, begun bunching up the silk of her nightgown until her leg was bare. The material sliding up her skin tickled her.</p>

<p>Could he see her?</p>

<p>“I think about what it would be like every night.” <em>Me too.</em> “I think about what it would be like to know what you taste like. Not just kissing you. Really the taste of you. I wish I could bury my face between your legs.”</p>

<p>“Jaime…”</p>

<p>“I know it’s wrong,” Her hand disappeared between her legs, fingers brushing where the cotton was wet. Jaime’s voice lulled her as she drew small circular patterns with her index, distracted. “I have tried fucking other women, but they all become you after a while. I’ve fucked you a thousand times in my head. Over and over.”</p>

<p>Cersei stepped away from the window and leaned against the wall for support. She pushed the cotton aside and found her clit throbbing and wanting. She knew he could hear her pant through the phone, but she had no intention of stopping.</p>

<p>“Your moaning won’t leave my ears. I hear it every waking moment.” She moaned at <em>that</em>. “Yeah,” he chuckled. “Exactly.”</p>

<p>What excuse would she find for this in the morning? He was drunk, but she was perfectly sober and sound of mind. <em>Not so much,</em> some would disagree. But her muscles were tightening, and her fingers were coated in her own juices, making it all easier. He was breathing quite hard too, and she pictured him with his cock in his hand, eyes snapped shut trying to picture her doing the same.</p>

<p>Was this any less scandalous than if they’d just…</p>

<p>Her teeth sank into her bottom lip, sharp pain suggesting she might have drawn blood. The moaning was more frequent now, the ringing in her ears growing persistent as she reached her climax. And when she finally tumbled over that edge, it was with a curse on her lips, and a whisper that sounded dreadfully like the last thing she should have said.</p>

<p>His name.</p>

<p>He gave her time to recover. There was no awkwardness between them. Cersei peeked outside, and saw Jaime looking at her window. She wasn’t sure, not from that distance, but he seemed to be smiling.</p>

<p>“Happy birthday, Jaime,” she whispered, spent.</p>

<p>Jaime chuckled into the phone and closed the call. Seconds later the black town car sped up the street and out of sight.</p>

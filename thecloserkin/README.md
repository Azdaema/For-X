		<p>Urbino,</p>
		<p>July 2nd, 1502</p>
	</div>

	<p class="greeting">Signora Duchessa Donna Lucretia de Borgia da Este, our very dearest sister,</p>

	<p>Confident of the circumstance that there can be no more efficacious and salutary medicine for the indisposition from which you are at present suffering than the announcement of good and happy news, we advise you that we have at this very moment received sure tidings of the capture of Camerino. We beg that you will do honor to this message by an immediate reply, and inform us of it, because, tormented as we are to know you so ill, nothing, not even this felicitous event, can suffice to afford us pleasure. We beg you also kindly to convey the present to the Illustrious Lord Don Alfonso, your husband and our beloved brother-in-law, to whom we are not writing today.</p>

	<p class="closing">Your brother, who loves you as he loves himself</p>

	<p class="signature">Cesare</p>
